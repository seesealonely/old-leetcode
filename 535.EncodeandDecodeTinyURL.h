/*
TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

    // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.

    // Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
    string decode(string shortUrl) {

// Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Solution solution;
